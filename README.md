# SnapClass
SnapClass is an advanced on-device edge AI solution designed for low-connectivity, high-density classroom environments. Powered by Snapdragonâ€™s Hexagon NPU, it runs open-source large language models (LLMs), image captioning, and audio transcription entirely offline. SnapClass automates personalized learning by transcribing lectures, analyzing textbook content, and generating adaptive quizzesâ€”bridging educational gaps in underserved regions where internet access and qualified educators are limited.

- Lightweight and fast inference using sentence embeddings

## Setup & Usage
### Step 1: Setup Local Hotspot (No Internet)
We use [MyPublicWifi](https://mypublicwifi.com/publicwifi/en/index.html) to create a local area dead network
1. Download and Install MyPublicWifi.
2. Open the app, set:
   - Network Access = No Internet Sharing
   - Turn on hotspot
3. Note the IP address shown in the app. This IP will be used to access the server from other devices.

### Step 2:Install Python Dependencies
1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Abbilaash/SnapClass.git
cd SnapClass
```
2. Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install [AnythingLLM](https://anythingllm.com/) and activate AnythingLLM NPU to process LLM models in Qualcomm Hexagon NPU.
Download ```Phi 3.5 Mini Instruct 4K 2.00GB``` model.
Get you AnythingLLM Developer API from Settings>Tools>Developer API>Generate New API Key and get you workspace slug.
Replace you API key in ```server/config.yaml``` as ```api_key: <API>``` and ```workspace_slug: <my-workspace>```

### Step 3: Start the server
```
cd server
python app.py
```
Once started, the server runs locally on port ```5000```

## Access the Web Interface
- Teacher Dashboard (same server device)
```http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin```
Use the IP address shown in MyPublicWifi ad access the students portal
- Student Test Page
```http://<IP>:5000```
Replace <IP> with the one shown in the MyPublicWifi app after enabling the hotspot
